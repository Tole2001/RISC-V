# RISC-V Project: Threads, Semaphores, and Manual Context Switching

Welcome to the **RISC-V Project**, a playground for low-level programming and system design! This repository is packed with C and C++ implementations of essential operating system concepts, all running on the RISC-V architecture. It includes threads, semaphores, manual thread switching, memory allocation, and even some good old-fashioned assembly code.

## Features

### Threads
- **C and C++ Implementations**: Multithreading support implemented from scratch.
- **Manual Context Switching**: Threads are switched manually, giving you full control over the scheduling process.

### Semaphores
- Implementation of semaphores to synchronize threads and manage shared resources effectively.
- Classic producer-consumer problem? Solved.

### Memory Allocation
- Custom memory allocation tailored for the RISC-V architecture.
- Manage memory blocks and optimize resource usage for embedded systems or simulations.

### Assembly Code
- Low-level assembly routines for thread management and system calls.
- Learn and appreciate the intricacies of the RISC-V instruction set.

## Why This Project?
This project is an exploration of the inner workings of operating systems and RISC-V. It's designed for:
- Students learning about operating systems and architecture.
- Developers curious about how threads and semaphores work under the hood.
- Anyone brave enough to dive into manual context switching.

## Acknowledgments
- The RISC-V Foundation for an open and extensible architecture.
- Countless operating system and compiler design textbooks.
- All the coffee that powered late-night debugging sessions.
